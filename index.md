## About Me

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
I am a M.S. student at <a href="https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST AI</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bispl.weebly.com/professor.html">Jong Chul Ye</a>.
I earned my B.S. in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering and Artificial Inteligence (Double Major) from <a href="https://snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University (SNU)</a> in Feb.2025.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
My research focuses on improving the controllability for <u>image and video synthesis</u>, including both generation and editing. 
I believe that mathematical theories help us understand why these models work and provide better intuition for developing future methods and applications.
